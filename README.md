# xTemplate.js

## What is xTemplate.js

xTemplate.js is a rewritten PHP xTemplate class, works nearly same as PHP version. I really don't know if there were another features which I didn't implement, but suits for all of my needs.

Who doesn't know about PHP xTemplate, this is a class simply for templating front end pages and separating designer and developer or view and controller. Frontend developer creates .html (or any extension) files, backend or (nodejs) developer uses the template to generate the resulting page. It is in active development as of June 8, 2019

By the way, this <u>currently</u> suits best to pure javascripters and for those who remembers PHP xtemplate class. Exactly for oldschool people (like me). Works mostly similar as it was in PHP. What I code in the class maybe full of shi*, maybe not. Works unbelievably fast and eases my own work. Who wants to make it cleaner, faster; commitments, additions, deletions, fixes to my code are welcome. I successfully used this class on 3 different projects without problems.

## Features

* String assignment
* Object assignment
* Template File Caching
* global (or window) String and Object automatic assignment (this eases the most of the work)
* Partial parsing of template (you can put list page, edit page into same template file)
* Direct parse output to selector (first) or append to selector (first) (.out function)
* Get the text for assigning to another template (.text function)

## How to use

### Basic Scenario

**tpl/users.html**

    <!-- BEGIN: main -->
    
        <!-- BEGIN: list -->
            <h2>{page_title}</h2>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>ID</td>
                        <td>{str._USERNAME}</td>
                        <td>{str._CITY}</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <!-- BEGIN: user -->
                    <tr>
                        <td>{userObj.id}</td>
                        <td>{userObj.name}</td>
                        <td>{userObj.city}</td>
                    </tr>
                    <!-- END: user -->
                </tbody>
            </table>
        <!-- END: list -->

        <!-- BEGIN: add_edit -->
        Here is your add/edit form
        <!-- END: add_edit -->
    
    <!-- END: main -->

**someFrontendJavascript.js** (Don't use this name, use whatever else you want)

    // You have a window object named str which includes your language specific
    // strings and changes with active language, something like below
    var str = {
        _USERNAME: "Username",
        _CITY: "City",
    }
    // Here comes your logic:
    // You pull users (probably json format) from server,
    // and now it is an array of user objects like below
    var users = [
        {
            id: 1,
            name: "John",
            city: "New York",
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            name: "Doe"
            city: "Paris"
        }
    ];
    var tpl = new xTemplate('tpl/users.html');
    tpl.assign('page_title','Users Page');
    users.forEach(function(user) {
        tpl.assign('obj',user);
        tpl.parse('main.list.user');
    });
    tpl.parse('main.list');
    tpl.out('main.list','#content');

**output.html** will look like this

    <!-- HTML stuff here head body etc. -->
    <script src="someFrontendJavascript.js></script>
    <div id="content">
            <h2>Users Page</h2>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>ID</td>
                        <td>Username</td>
                        <td>City</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1</td>
                        <td>John</td>
                        <td>New York</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>2</td>
                        <td>Doe</td>
                        <td>Paris</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
    </div>
